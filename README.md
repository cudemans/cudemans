<p align='left'>I'm a data journalist and reporter from South Africa. I use data to tell stories, and love digging into big datasets to uncover hidden insights. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as China-focused data reporter
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning natural language processing and Svelte.js
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Python projects, data visualizations, and data reporting </p>

Most recently, I've been tracking the COVID-19 vaccine rollout across the US. Take a look [here](https://covid-vac-us.herokuapp.com) and feel free to send feedback.
